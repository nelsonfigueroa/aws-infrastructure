# AWS Infrastructure.

This project was completed to learn Terraform and strengthen my AWS knowledge. I implemented [AWS VPC Scenario 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html) using Terraform.

**Try it yourself (Previous Terraform and AWS CLI set up required)**

Navigate to the cloned directory and initialize Terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

Create an execution plan

```shell
terraform plan
```

Apply the execution plan

```shell
terraform apply
```
