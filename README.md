# AWS Infrastructure.

This project was completed to learn Terraform and strengthen my AWS knowledge. I implemented [AWS VPC Scenario 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html) using Terraform. This code was used for a previous blog I set up, which is why there are many resources that have "blog" in their name.

---

**Try it yourself (Previous Terraform and AWS CLI set up required)**

Ensure that the code is valid:

```shell
terraform validate
```

Navigate to the cloned directory and initialize Terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

Create an execution plan

```shell
terraform plan
```

Apply the execution plan

```shell
terraform apply
```
